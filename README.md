# PureMVC

Swift implementation of the [PureMVC](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-objectivec-standard-framework) standard. Includes small deviations from other Swift versions including a simple NotificationMediator protocol for easily integrating notification sending/receiving to a UIViewController. Also, all event responses are guaranteed on the UI thread.
